<h1 class="title" id="structs-in-go">Structs in Go</h1>
<p>A struct is a composite data type that groups together variables
under a single name. These variables, known as fields, can be of
different types. Structs are a fundamental concept in Go for creating
complex data structures.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="defining-and-using-structs">Defining and Using
Structs</h2>
<p>You can define a struct using the <code>type</code> and
<code>struct</code> keywords. Once a struct type is defined, you can
create instances (values) of that struct.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import &quot;fmt&quot;

// Define a struct type
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    // Create an instance of the Person struct
    p1 := Person{Name: &quot;Alice&quot;, Age: 30}
    fmt.Println(p1)

    // Accessing struct fields
    fmt.Println(&quot;Name:&quot;, p1.Name)
    fmt.Println(&quot;Age:&quot;, p1.Age)

    // You can also create a pointer to a struct
    p2 := &amp;Person{Name: &quot;Bob&quot;, Age: 25}
    fmt.Println(p2.Name) // Go automatically dereferences the pointer
}</code></pre>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="methods-on-structs">Methods on Structs</h2>
<p>Go allows you to define methods on struct types. A method is a
function with a special receiver argument. The receiver appears in its
own argument list between the <code>func</code> keyword and the method
name.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import &quot;fmt&quot;

type Rectangle struct {
    Width, Height float64
}

// A method for the Rectangle struct
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.Width * r.Height
}

func main() {
    rect := Rectangle{Width: 10, Height: 5}
    fmt.Println(&quot;Area:&quot;, rect.Area())
}</code></pre>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="embedding-structs">Embedding Structs</h2>
<p>Go does not provide inheritance in the traditional sense, but it does
support composition through struct embedding. You can embed a struct
within another struct to “inherit” its fields and methods.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import &quot;fmt&quot;

type Engine struct {
    Horsepower int
}

func (e Engine) Start() {
    fmt.Println(&quot;Engine started.&quot;)
}

type Car struct {
    Engine // Embed the Engine struct
    Make   string
    Model  string
}

func main() {
    car := Car{
        Engine: Engine{Horsepower: 300},
        Make:   &quot;Toyota&quot;,
        Model:  &quot;Camry&quot;,
    }

    // The Car struct now has the fields and methods of Engine
    fmt.Println(&quot;Horsepower:&quot;, car.Horsepower)
    car.Start()
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a powerful feature that allows for flexible and reusable
code.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle" id="key-features-of-structs">Key Features of
Structs</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composition:</strong> Structs are the primary way to build
complex data types in Go.</li>
<li><strong>Methods:</strong> You can define methods on structs to add
behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Embedding:</strong> Structs can be embedded within other
structs to promote code reuse.</li>
<li><strong>Value vs. Pointer Receivers:</strong> Methods can have
either a value or a pointer receiver, which affects whether the method
can modify the original struct.</li>
</ul>
