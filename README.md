How To Go is a hands-on learning resource for the Go programming language. Inspired by Go By Example, this repository provides concise, runnable Go examples that teach real concepts through real code.

Purpose: remove friction from learning. Every example must be runnable, simple, and focused.

## Why This Project Exists

Modern developers learn by doing. Books, docs, and tutorials are useful but rarely designed for the fastest path to operational fluency. How To Go solves that by:

- Teaching concepts through runnable code  
- Eliminating noise and academic filler  
- Providing real-world examples and patterns  
- Increasing depth over time with iteration  

How To Go is not a rewrite of the Go spec or standard documentation; it is a bridge between theory and practice.

## Target Audience

- Developers new to Go  
- Experienced programmers switching languages  
- Cloud & systems engineers expanding skillsets  
- People who want reference examples, fast

## Core Principles

1. **Minimal Complexity**  
   Examples are small, targeted, and easy to run.

2. **Direct Utility**  
   Every example must demonstrate value.

3. **Progressive Depth**  
   Beginners start simple. Experts dig deeper.

4. **Real Code Only**  
   No pseudocode. No placeholders. No theory without proof.

## Project Status

Actively developed. New examples added continuously.  
Goal: 300+ runnable examples across all major topics.
